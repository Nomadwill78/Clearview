> Analyze a deal in seconds. Know your numbers before you write an offer.

## What is FlipOS?

FlipOS is a browser-based tool for real estate investors who flip houses. Enter a property's numbers — purchase price, rehab budget, ARV, and holding period — and get an instant, itemized breakdown of every dollar at stake: total cost stack, gross profit, ROI, 70% rule check, daily holding cost, and net profit after tax.

Beyond the financial analysis, a built-in **Scope Builder** lets you walk a property and build a line-item rehab estimate across 12 areas of a home. The scope total flows automatically into the deal analysis. Pro users can export a contractor-ready PDF scope of work to hand to their GCs.

No account required to start. Everything is saved in your browser.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+

### Local setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Nomadwill78/Clearview.git
cd Clearview

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the environment variable template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app runs fully without any environment variables — auth is disabled and the payment API returns a friendly 503.

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in values as needed. All variables are optional — the app degrades gracefully when they are absent.

```env
# ── CLERK (optional) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Auth is disabled and the Sign in button is hidden until these are set.
# Get these from clerk.com → your app → API Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# ── STRIPE (optional) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Checkout returns a 503 until all three are set.
# Get the secret key from dashboard.stripe.com → Developers → API Keys
# Create two subscription prices in Stripe and paste the price_... IDs here.
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY=price_...   # $29/month subscription
STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL=price_...    # $290/year subscription

# ── STRIPE WEBHOOK (optional) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Required only for account-bound Pro (syncs plan via Clerk publicMetadata).
# Create a webhook endpoint in Stripe pointing to:
#   https://your-domain.com/api/stripe-webhook
# Events: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated,
#         customer.subscription.deleted
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Stripe setup (for payments)

1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Create two **recurring** prices:
   - $29.00 / month → copy the `price_...` ID to `STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY`
   - $290.00 / year → copy the `price_...` ID to `STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL`
3. Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` from your Stripe dashboard
4. For webhooks: add an endpoint at `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe-webhook`, subscribe to the three events listed above, and copy the signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Clerk setup (for account-bound Pro)

1. Create a Clerk app at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Copy the Publishable Key and Secret Key into your env file
3. Enable the `plan` field in Clerk public metadata (the webhook handler writes `{ plan: "pro" | "free" }` there)

---

## Deployment

The project is pre-configured for **zero-config Vercel deployment**.

### Vercel (recommended)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import the repository
3. Vercel auto-detects Next.js — no build settings to change
4. Add your environment variables in the Vercel project settings
5. Deploy

**Auto-deploy behavior:**
- `main` branch → production (`flipos-tau.vercel.app`)
- Any other branch → preview URL (posted as a PR comment)

### Self-hosted

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000. Put it behind any reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.).

### Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |

| Auth | Clerk (optional) |
| Payments | Stripe Subscriptions |
| PDF | @react-pdf/renderer (lazy-loaded) |
| Analytics | Vercel Web Analytics |
| Hosting | Vercel |

### Data flow

- **Deals** are stored as JSON in `localStorage` under `flipos.deals.v1`. No server database — the app is fully client-side for core features.
- **Photos** are canvas-compressed (1400px main / 900px item) and stored in IndexedDB to stay within localStorage size limits.
- **Plan state** is stored device-locally in `localStorage` after a Stripe Checkout success redirect. When Clerk auth is enabled, plan state is also written to Clerk `publicMetadata` via the Stripe webhook, making Pro account-bound.

## Roadmap

### In progress
- [ ] Cloud sync — deals backed up and accessible across devices (Clerk-gated)

### Planned
- [ ] Comparable sales lookup — pull ARV comps from public records
- [ ] Lender templates — save hard money terms for repeat lenders
- [ ] Deal sharing — generate a read-only link to share a deal with partners
- [ ] Mobile app — native iOS/Android wrapper
- [ ] Rehab cost database — regional labor and material cost benchmarks
- [ ] Portfolio view — track all active and completed flips in one dashboard
- [ ] Profit tracking — log actuals vs estimates after the flip sells

### Someday / maybe
- [ ] MLS integration for automated ARV pulls
- [ ] GC bid management — collect and compare bids against the scope
- [ ] Tax reporting — profit/loss summaries by tax year
